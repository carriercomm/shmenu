shellmenu 0.10 notes

Author:  Michael A. Taylor <encephalophone@gmail.com>

A work-in-progress.  The purpose of this project is to provide a simplified tool for quickly creating and maintaining menu-driven shell scripts, while addressing some problems with whiptail and zenity.  It is essentially a wrapper for whiptail and zenity with the ability to also create menus in a terminal where neither are available.

Pre-requisites:

  bash
  a terminal emulator
  tput
  grep, egrep
  awk
  sed
  bc


One of the following is recommended.
  whiptail
  zenity
